# Team-Admeyerable-Pennybags -- Alan Chen and Calvin Vuong
APCS1 Final Project

The Pass-n-Play Monopoly!

Welcome to Admeyerable Pennybags' Monopoly! Here, you can choose to play with up to three other friends by passing around your laptop! To run the game, simply type these commands into your terminal:
- javac *.java
- java Monopoly

and you're good to go!

Our current version features:
- Most of the awe-inspiring features from the original Monopoly!
  - The Primary Essentials: moving, buying properties, paying rent, building houses, going to jail
  - The Secondary Auxilliaries: chance/community chest, taxes, mortgaging, trading, auctioning
- The ability to save your progress midgame. We know how long Monopoly can get!
- Endless possibilites to get super-rich!

Things to Keep in Mind:
- Our system is pretty troll-proof. It'll be hard to crash it. But you shouldn't try. That'll be like trying to crash your bank.
- The savefile is just a plain old textfile. Corrupting it by editing it outside the program might crash the game. If you are foolish and do decide to do that, simply delete savefile.txt.  

Our AI system is in beta mode and is therefore not incorporated into Monopoly. You can see our code for the AI in BetaAI.java.
We have unfortunately not implemented a minigame free-parking space as suggested by our proposal due to lack of funding. (time) :(
